<p >I am Karim Belford and I am a third year computer science major at the university of Windsor. I was born April 7th 2000 in Kingston Jamaica. I moved to Canada when I was 9 and lived in Ottawa for four years and then moved to Bolton Ontario where I went to Humberview Secondary School.

<p align ="center">The reason that I choose to major in Computer Science is because in grade 11 I took a computer science course and made an arcade game for my final project and enjoyed it that is why I took computer science. The programing languages that I know or have knowledge in are C, C++, HTML, SQL and Java. The languages I am trying to learn this summer is Javascript, react and python. </p>
<br>

<p align ="right">Some of the things I like to do outside of school is to play sports. My favorite sport to play is soccer. I played academy soccer for 3 years when I was in high school. I no longer play competitive but I like to go to the field with my roommates to play. The other sport that I enjoy playing is basketball. Basketball is my favourite sport to watch that is why I like to play it. My favourite team in the NBA is the Boston Celtics and my favourtie player in the NBA is Kevin Durant. Playing video games is also another hobby of mine and my favourite game to play at the moment is Call of Duty Warzone.</p>
